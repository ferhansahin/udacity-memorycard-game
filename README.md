## How to start

The initial commit: https://github.com/ferhansahin/udacity-memorycard-game.git

## Functionality

It's a simple card matching game. A player can flip two cards in one turn. If they match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip over again.
The game has implemented functions of game raiting (3 to 1 start, when 3 is a win with the least count of moves), tracking a time from start to winning the game and restarting the game.

## How to play

You have to click on two cards to open them in order to make a comparison between them , If two cards were matched it will change their color to green with some of different animation to let you know that they are matched. You have to get all cards matched to win and to see your final result

Moves counts increase by two opened or matched cards

After opens all matched cards a pop-up message will appear and contains your duration time , number of your moves and your rating level and finally the play again button to play again .
